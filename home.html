                <p>CORE URBAN RENEW LLP. (CORE) is a mission based developer focused solely on urban Kansas City, Missouri properties.  Founded in 2020 to improve housing quality in Urban Renewal Areas, CORE has solidified partnerships with contractors fully capable of supporting our vision in neighborhood developments.</p>
                <br>
                <p>CORE has developed 48 properties since 2021. Our experience has included management of several contractors, and the development of a network of preferred contractors. Through this work we have supported extensive rehabilitation projects that have addressed neglect at the most egregious levels in homes built 90+ years ago. In short, we have seen it all.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We have worked with investors, for profit and non-profit entities, and for our own interests in developing urban Kansas City properties.  In each case, we have been acknowledged as ethical, committed and hard working in our approach to a quality outcome.</p>
